Southeast Missouri State University 2D Game Development Project

This is our Term Project at Southeast Missouri State University. We are writing a 2D platformer in XNA Game Studio. The big things we are include here are:
- Multiple enemies with varying AIs
- Side scrolling
- Moving background
- Sound effects, Background music
- Animated sprites
- Multiple levels
- Title screen, Level selection screen, Ending screen

We have some cool enemies planned out already. Say hello to:
- Emu
  - A large, aggressive, flightless pecking bird
- Frog
  - An always-in-your-way jumping beast with collision intersection AI
- Soda Guy
  - This one's a lot of fun. The Soda Guy sits on the ground next to his bottomless six pack and repeated a cycle of aggrevated littering. Soda Guy picks up a can, chugs away, then pitches the can on the ground where it rolls, bounces and trips up the player.

As far as explosions, sweet graphics and other cool ideas, well - we'll see what we can accomplish before Finals: Fall 2015
