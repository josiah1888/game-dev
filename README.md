# Jump Death
Southeast Missouri State University 2D Game Development Project

This is our Term Project at Southeast Missouri State University. We are writing a 2D platformer in C# with the XNA Framework. The big things we have included here are:
- Multiple enemies with varying AIs
- Side scrolling
- Moving background elements
- Sound effects, Background music
- Particle explosions and smoke effects
- Animated sprites
- Ten levels with transitions
- Splash screens
- Parallel processing
- Most importantly, object oriented, maintainable, SOLID C# code

Say hello to the fearsome enemies in Jump Death:
- Emu
  - A large, aggressive, flightless pecking bird
- Frog
  - An always-in-your-way jumping beast with collision intersection AI
- Soda Guy
  - This one's a lot of fun. The Soda Guy sits on the ground next to his bottomless six pack and repeated a cycle of aggrevated littering. Soda Guy picks up a can, chugs away, then pitches the can on the ground where it rolls, bounces and trips up the player.
